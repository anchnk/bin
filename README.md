# dotbin

This repository holds custom scripts I have created, made, borrowed, hacked.

My `$HOME` folder contains a `bin` folder which is a **symbolic link** of
`$HOME/code/public/anchnk/dotbin`.<br />
`$HOME/bin` is in `$PATH` so that each script can be executed just by calling
its name.

## Scripts listing

[`disable-touchpad.sh`](disable-touchpad.sh) | TBD

Note: this repository contains experimental code and should be considered as an
evolving work in progresss.
