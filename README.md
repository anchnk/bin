# dotbin

This repository holds custom scripts I have created, made, borrowed, hacked. It
sits in my $HOME folder under a `bin` folder. That repository is a mirror of
that folder and will evolve with time.

note: this repository contains experimental code and should be considered as an
evolving work in progresss.
