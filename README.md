This repository holds custom scripts I have created, made, borrowed, hacked. It
sits in my $HOME folder under a `bin` folder. That repository is a mirror of
that folder and will evolve with time.

note: this repository contains experimental code and should be considered as an
evolving work in progresss.

## Scripts

- [`remap-esc-to-capslock.sh`](remap-esc-to-capslock.sh): remap ESC key to
  capslock
