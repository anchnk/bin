# dotbin

This repository holds custom scripts I have created, made, borrowed, hacked.

My `$HOME` folder contains a `bin` folder which is a **symbolic link** of
`$HOME/code/public/anchnk/dotbin`.<br />
`$HOME/bin` is in `$PATH` so that each script can be executed just by calling
its name.

## Scripts listing

Script | Purpose
-------|------------
[`disable-touchpad.sh`](disable-touchpad.sh) | disable laptop trackball
[`hxvw`](hxvw) | visualise hex colors with dunst
[`launch-polybar.sh`](launch-polybar.sh) | kill all polybar running instances and start a new one
[`ls-ppas.sh`](ls-ppas.sh) | list installed PPAs
[`monitors-setup.sh`](monitors-setup.sh) | configure randr according to the number of connected monitors
[`remap-esc-to-capslock.sh`](remap-esc-to-capslock.sh) | remap capslock to escape key for vim / neovim
[`set-bg.sh`](set-bg.sh) | set desktop's wallpaper using feh

Note: this repository contains experimental code and should be considered as an
evolving work in progresss.
